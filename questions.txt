1. I mainly use c++ for programming, and pointers are something I hate. Some C programmers are referred to as 
“Three Star Programmers”.  However, languages like python and java which are used for this assignment do not 
have pointers. I understand that pointers can cause memory leaks but is it the main reason we don't have it 
anymore? We can solve problems without pointers. Is pointer outdated now? 

2. Even though the assignment asked about JDK and JREs are sold separately. I have no idea why. So I have to ask back, why?

3. What is reflection? We do have the definition which is “run-time access to their types and structures and 
to be able to dynamically modify their behavior.” The applications we are writing are large and complex. Is 
really confusing to me and hard to understand the usefulness and benefit of it. 

4.   It is the first time I learned about JVM (Java virtual machine). I am not sure what it is and what it does. 
Many high level programming languages have interpreters and compilers. They help produce results of programs or 
translate code to assembly language. Is JVM similar to one of the above?
